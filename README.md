# Overview
In the quest to develop more accurate flood forecasting systems, this project leverages advanced deep learning models to predict river gage heights, a crucial parameter for flood monitoring. By understanding interconnected river data, our goal is to provide an effective tool to anticipate and mitigate potential flood hazards.
# Features
**Data Visualization:** Before diving into modeling, we engaged in an extensive exploratory data analysis, visualizing the mean and variance distribution of each dataset column.
**Stationarity Checks:** Ensured the time series data's stationarity by implementing the Dickey-Fuller test, a pivotal step for any time series forecasting endeavor.
**Deep Learning Models:** We ventured into various deep learning models, comparing their efficacies:
WaveNet
LSTM
GRU
ConvLSTM
STAM (Spatiotemporal Attention Model)
